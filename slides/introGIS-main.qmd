- **softwares to handle spatial data**
- **data stored with their coordinates**
- **defined projection system**

## Projection

> There is no perfect projection.

The projection system will depend on the objective and the spatial extent.

**Equi:** 
- distant, equidistant
- area - equalarea
- azimut, conformal

Every country has one (or many) reference projection system(s), a long list [here](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e8b85d508d2c4f21a3dec4e52dc7d9c4/data).
One system to name them all: [EPSG](https://epsg.io/)

Main issue if you study large areas, or polar regions.

## The most commun projection system

France
Europe
World:  
- World Geodetic System 1984, [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)
- Google, OSM, WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator [EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857)

Local map: [UTM](https://gisgeography.com/utm-universal-transverse-mercator-projection/)

## When must you care about projection?

**Crossing information from different source**
- Make sure the projection system are the same, else project

**Calculating distances, or areas** 
use appropriate projection system (e.g. equalarea for areas)*

* `terra` now indicates that most precise calculation are spherical with lat/long coordinates
** but not with `sf`, unless s2 deactivated, calculation with s2 makes issue, not intuitive
*** be carefull of the unit too!

## Spatial data

There are two world views: raster vs vector
a nice image

## Data format

raster vs vector

## R packages

raster vs vector

## Is R a good GIS software?
