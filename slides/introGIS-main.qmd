- **softwares to handle spatial data**
- **data stored with their coordinates**
- **defined projection system**

## Projection

> There is no perfect projection.

The projection system will depend on the objective and the spatial extent.

**Equi:** 
- distant, equidistant
- area - equalarea
- azimut, conformal

Every country has one (or many) reference projection system(s), a long list [here](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e8b85d508d2c4f21a3dec4e52dc7d9c4/data).
<https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/analytics/geodesic-or-planar-which-to-use-for-distance-analysis>
One system to name them all: [EPSG](https://epsg.io/)

Main issue if you study large areas, or polar regions.

## The most commun projection system

France
Europe
World:  
- World Geodetic System 1984, [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)
- Google, OSM, WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator [EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857)

Local map: [UTM](https://gisgeography.com/utm-universal-transverse-mercator-projection/)

## When must you care about projection?

**Crossing information from different source**
- Make sure the projection system are the same, else project

**Calculating distances, or areas** 
use appropriate projection system (e.g. equalarea for areas)*

* `terra` now indicates that most precise calculation are spherical with lat/long coordinates
** but not with `sf`, unless s2 deactivated, calculation with s2 makes issue, not intuitive
*** be carefull of the unit too!

## Two world views: Raster vs Vector

<!-- https://gisgeography.com/spatial-data-types-vector-raster/ -->


## Data format

raster vs vector


vector: **Geopackage** is most recommended (and it can host raster too)  

ESRI shapefile | shp | format from ESRI ArcGIS | (+): very commun, lightweight (-): multiple files (dbf, shx, shp, prj), transform variable names (10 characters)
kml |kml | Google Earth file | (+): good for GoogleEarth (-) Google
Geopackage |gkpd| open format based on SQLite | (+): respect the format of original data,
geojson | geojson | plain text | (+) can be open and edited by hand, good for web API (-) only WGS84 supported, heavier storage size
GPS Exchange Format (GPX) |.gpx| is an XML schema designed for transferring GPS data between applications.

raster: **tif or nc**  

Network Common Data Form(NetCDF) |.nc| storing multi-dimensional, array-oriented variables
GRIdded Binary (GRIB) | .grb| standard by the WMO, multidimensional file with the advantages of self-description, flexibility and expandability. 
GeoTIFF |.tif| the image standard file for GIS and satellite remote sensing applications. It can store multiple realisations as “bands”. GeoTIFFs can be accompanied by other auxiliary files (.tfw for raster geolocation, .xml for metadata, .aux for projections and others, .ovr for pyramids to improve visualisation).
ASCII Grid | .asc| ASCII Grid files are simple text files that represent raster data
